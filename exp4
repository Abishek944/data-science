Aim:
Reading data from text files, excel and the web and exploring various commands for
doing descriptive analytics on the Iris data set.
What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique to analyze data using some visual
Techniques. With this technique, we can get detailed information about the statistical summary
of the data. We will also be able to deal with the duplicates values, outliers, and also see some
trends or patterns present in the dataset.
Now let’s see a brief about the Iris dataset.
Iris Dataset
If you are from a data science background you all must be familiar with the Iris Dataset. If you
are not then don’t worry we will discuss this here.
Iris Dataset is considered as the Hello World for data science. It contains five columns namely
– Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Species Type. Iris is a flowering
plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded
them digitally.
4A). Aim:

Reading data from Text file and exploring various commands for doing

descriptive analytics on the Iris data set.
Seaborn Package:
Seaborn has many of its own high-level plotting routines, but it can also overwrite
Matplotlib&#39;s default parameters and in turn get even simple Matplotlib scripts to produce vastly
superior output. We can set the style by calling Seaborn&#39;s set() method. By convention, Seaborn
is imported as sns:
Seaborn package is installed by typing the following command in the command prompt

pip install seaborn

Step 2:
After the successful insertion of seaborn package launch into jupyter using jupyter
notebook command. Type the following program. Give the correct path name for iris dataset.
The Iris dataset, which lists measurements of petals and sepals of three iris species.
Step 1:
Import Packages
In[1]:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd # package for working with data frames in python
import seaborn as sns # package for visualization (more on seaborn later)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
Step 2:
Import iris dataset
In[2]:
iris = sns.load_dataset(&#39;iris&#39;)
my_data_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris)
my_data_frame.head()

OUTPUT

Step 3: Simple plot
In[3]:
p=plt.hist(my_data_frame.sepal_length)

OUTPUT

Step: 4 Plot using Seaborn
In[4]:
g = sns.pairplot(my_data_frame)
OUTPUT

Step 5: Colour plot
In[5]:

sns.set(style=&quot;ticks&quot;, color_codes=True) # change style g
= sns.pairplot(iris, hue=&quot;species&quot;)

OUTPUT:

In [6]:
g = sns.pairplot(iris, height=3, vars=[&quot;sepal_width&quot;, &quot;sepal_length&quot;], \

markers=[&quot;o&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;D&quot;], hue=&quot;species&quot;)

OUTPUT

In [7]:

g = sns.pairplot(iris, kind=&quot;reg&quot;, hue=&quot;species&quot;)
OUTPUT

In[8]:
sns.set(style=&quot;ticks&quot;, color_codes=True) # change
style g = sns.pairplot(iris, hue=&quot;species&quot;)

Result:
Thus reading data from Text file and exploring various commands for doing descriptive
analytics on the Iris data set is executed.
